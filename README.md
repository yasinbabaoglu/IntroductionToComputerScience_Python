13. **17-selection sort.py**: Implements the selection sort algorithm to sort a list.
14. **21-linear_search.py**: Implements linear search to find an element in a list.
15. **binarySearch.py**: Demonstrates binary search on a sorted list.

### Data Manipulation and String Operations

16. **12-swap.py**: Swaps two variables' values.
17. **14-max.py**: Finds the maximum value in a set of numbers.
18. **15-min.py**: Finds the minimum value in a set of numbers.
19. **16-min(array).py**: Finds the minimum value in an array.
20. **18-uppercase_detection.py**: Detects uppercase characters in a string.
21. **19-make_uppercase.py**: Converts a string to uppercase.
22. **20-count_of_char.py**: Counts the occurrence of characters in a string.

### Matrix Operations and Data Structures

23. **22-matrix_multiplication.py**: Multiplies two matrices.
24. **23-matrix_multiplication_data**: Example data for matrix multiplication.
25. **BinaryTree.py**: Implements basic operations on a binary tree.
26. **LinkedList.py**: Implements a simple linked list with basic operations.
27. **list.py**: Demonstrates basic list operations in Python.
28. **list_dict_tuple_set.py**: Shows how to use lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets in Python.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

29. **oop.py**: Demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts.
30. **oop_run.py**: Runs the OOP examples from oop.py.

### Recursive Functions

31. **recursive.py**: Shows how to use recursion to solve problems like factorial and Fibonacci.

### Additional Scripts

32. **Answer1.py**: A miscellaneous script solving a specific problem or question.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required to run these scripts.
- Basic understanding of Python syntax and programming concepts is recommended.

### Running the Scripts

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yasinbabaoglu/IntroductionToComputerScience_Python.git
   cd IntroductionToComputerScience_Python
   

2. Run any script using Python:

   bash
   python script_name.py
   

   Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you wish to run.

## Learning Outcomes

By exploring these scripts, you will learn:

- Basic arithmetic and mathematical operations in Python.
- How to implement common algorithms like sorting, searching, and prime checking.
- Data structures including arrays, lists, linked lists, and trees.
- Basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
- Recursive functions and their applications.
- How to work with strings, matrices, and other data types in Python.
